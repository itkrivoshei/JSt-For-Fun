The Restaurant Page project, inspired by [The Odin Project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list), is a React-based web application showcasing a virtual restaurant. It features a simple, yet elegant landing page with navigation options to explore different sections of the restaurant, including Home, Menu, and Contact.

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Each section of the restaurant - Home, Menu, and Contact - is rendered dynamically using React.
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Users can easily navigate between the Home, Menu, and Contact tabs.

## 💻 Technologies

- **React**: For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Webpack**: Underlying bundling and development server.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used.
- **SCSS**: For styling components and enhancing the visual appeal.

## 🚀 Usage

- **Navigation**: Utilize the tabbed interface to switch between Home, Menu, and Contact pages.
- **Menu Exploration**: View detailed descriptions and prices of various dishes.
- **Contact Information**: Access contact details of the restaurant.
