The [Restaurant Page](https://itkrivoshei.github.io/OdinMonoWebApps/#/Restaurant) project, inspired by [The Odin Project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list), is a React-based web application showcasing a virtual restaurant. It features a simple landing page with navigation options to explore different sections of the restaurant, including Home, Menu, and Contact.

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Each section of the restaurant - Home, Menu, and Contact - is rendered dynamically using React.
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Users can easily navigate between the Home, Menu, and Contact tabs.

## 💻 Technologies
