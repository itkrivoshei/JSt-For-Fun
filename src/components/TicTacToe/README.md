The [Tic Tac Toe](https://itkrivoshei.github.io/OdinMonoWebApps/#/TicTacToe) is a classic game created as a React project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe). This version of Tic Tac Toe is built using React, showcasing the ability to handle state and UI updates dynamically. Players can engage in a game against an AI opponent or opt for a traditional 2-player game. The game includes features like win detection, score tracking, and a reset function.

## üåü Key Features

- **Single Player vs AI**: Play against a computer-controlled opponent.
- **Two Player Mode**: A traditional Tic Tac Toe game for two players.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner.
- **Game Reset Function**: Easily reset the game for a new round.
- **Dynamic State Management**: Utilizes React's state management for real-time UI updates.

## üíª Technologies

- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and code maintainability.
- **State Management**: Managed within React's own state system.

## üöÄ Usage

- **Game Modes**: Choose between playing against AI or a second player.
- **Playing the Game**: Click on a square to make your move.
- **Restarting the Game**: Click the reset button to start a new game.

## üìö Assignment Details

This Tic Tac Toe game was developed as a React adaptation of the assignment from [The Odin Project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe). The assignment's requirements included:

- Setting up the project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Storing the gameboard as an array inside a Gameboard object and managing player objects.
- Minimizing global code by using factories and the module pattern.
- Developing a working game in the console first before focusing on the DOM and HTML/CSS.
- Creating a display object to handle the DOM logic.
- Implementing functions to allow players to interact with the DOM elements and add marks to the board.
- Ensuring logic to prevent players from playing in already taken spots.
- Adding a user interface for player names, game start/restart, and displaying results.
