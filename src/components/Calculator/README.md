</p>

The [Calculator App](https://itkrivoshei.github.io/OdinMonoWebApps/#/Calculator) is a web application designed for mathematical computations, inspired by the iconic IBM keyboard. This project, a creative take on the [Foundations Calculator assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) from The Odin Project, is developed using React, TypeScript, and SCSS. It mimics the style of an IBM keyboard numpad, including original sounds and colors, providing an engaging and nostalgic user experience.

## üåü Key Features

- **Basic Math Operations**: Includes functions like add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
- **IBM Keyboard Design**: Styled to resemble an IBM keyboard numpad, complete with sound effects.
- **Interactive Buttons**: React components for each calculator button, providing a tactile feel.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Keyboard Support**: Allows input via physical keyboard, enhancing usability.

## üíª Technologies

- **React**: Powers the dynamic user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and code reliability.
- **SCSS**: For stylish and manageable stylesheets.
- **Custom Sound Effects**: Using Howler.js for audio playback to mimic IBM keyboard sounds.
- **SVG Components**: React components created from SVGs for a crisp and scalable UI.

## üöÄ Usage

- **Math Operations**: Perform add, subtract, multiply, and divide operations.
- **Keyboard Interaction**: Use your keyboard for input, just like a physical calculator.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy the nostalgic clicks of an IBM keyboard with each button press.
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors for invalid operations, like division by zero.

## üåü Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the [Foundations Calculator assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) from The Odin Project.
- Special thanks to IBM for the design inspiration, and Howler.js for audio functionalities.

## üìö Assignment from The Odin Project

This Calculator App is a reimagined version of the project from [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). The assignment involved creating an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Key highlights of the project include:

- Incorporating basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Building a user interface that mimics the classic IBM keyboard numpad, including sound effects.
- Ensuring the calculator can handle complex mathematical statements securely, without using the `eval()` function.
- Designing responsive layouts and integrating keyboard support for enhanced user interaction.
