The [Odin Recipes App](https://itkrivoshei.github.io/OdinMonoWebApps/#/OdinRecipes) is a modern interpretation of the [Odin Project's Foundations Course Recipe Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). Originally designed to practice basic HTML skills, this version has been revamped using React, TypeScript, and Material UI.

## üåü Key Features

- **Recipe Selection**: Users can choose from multiple recipes like Homemade Lasagna, Acorn Squash, and Microwave Baked Potato.
- **Interactive Recipe Cards**: Each recipe is presented in a card format, including images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps.

## üíª Technologies

- **React**: For creating an interactive user interface.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and enhance code quality.
- **Material UI**: A popular React UI framework for elegant and efficient component design.

## üìö Assignment Adaptation

This version of the Odin Recipes App is an advanced take on the original assignment from The Odin Project, which was focused on HTML skills. This project extends the concept by incorporating React, TypeScript, and Material Ui to create a more interactive and sophisticated application. The assignment's key elements, such as creating a basic recipe website with multiple pages and links, are elevated through the use of modern web development tools and practices, showcasing the evolution from simple HTML to a fully functional React application.
