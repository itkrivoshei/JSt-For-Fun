## üìö Assignment from The Odin Project

As part of the assignment from [The Odin Project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list), this Todo Management App was crafted to demonstrate proficiency in various web development techniques. The assignment involved:

- Creating a todo list with dynamically generated objects using factories or constructors/classes.
- Incorporating features like title, description, due date, priority, notes, and checklists for todo items.
- Implementing project-based organization of todos with default and user-created projects.
- Separating application logic from DOM-related operations in different modules.
- Designing a user interface capable of viewing and managing todos with various functionalities like viewing all projects, editing todo details, and deleting todos.
- Utilizing localStorage for data persistence and managing JSON data retrieval and storage.
- Ensuring robustness and user data persistence across sessions.
