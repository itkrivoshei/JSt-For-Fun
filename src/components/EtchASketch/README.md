![](https://github.com/itkrivoshei/OdinMonoWebApps/blob/main/media/EtchASketch.gif?raw=true)

The Etch-A-Sketch App is a creative and interactive web application inspired by the classic drawing toy. This project was developed as part of [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch), redesigned using React, TypeScript, and SCSS for a modern and responsive user experience. Users can create pixelated artwork by moving their mouse over a grid, with customizable grid sizes and colors, including a unique rainbow and shadow mode.

## üåü Key Features

- **Customizable Grid**: Adjust the size of the drawing grid up to 100x100 pixels.
- **Color Options**: Choose the board color, drawing color, or select dynamic rainbow or shadow modes.
- **Interactive Drawing**: Create designs by hovering the mouse over the grid.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with React and SCSS for a smooth and responsive user interface.

## üíª Technologies

- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety and enhances code maintainability.
- **SCSS**: Advanced styling capabilities for a polished look.
- **Flexbox**: Used for creating the grid layout.

## üöÄ Usage

- **Grid Customization**: Users can set the grid size and choose board and drawing colors.
- **Drawing Modes**: Select between standard color, rainbow mode, or shadow mode for different drawing effects.
- **Responsive Grid**: The grid adapts to various screen sizes for a consistent drawing experience.

## üìö Assignment Details

The Etch-A-Sketch App was developed as part of the assignment for [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). The assignment objectives were:

- Build a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch using JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
- Create a 16x16 grid of divs using JavaScript, styled with CSS flexbox.
- Implement a hover effect to change the color of the grid divs.
- Add a button to change the grid size and color, and implement dynamic sketching modes.
- Push the project to GitHub.
