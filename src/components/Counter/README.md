# ðŸ”¢ Counter Component

The [Counter Component](https://itkrivoshei.github.io/OdinMonoWebApps/#/Counter) is a reusable, interactive component that allows users to increment a counter value with a button click. The current counter value is displayed, and a styled toast notification shows the updated value upon each increment. Built with React, Chakra UI, and TypeScript, designed for flexibility and ease of integration into other components.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Simple Increment**: Increases the counter value by 1 with each button click.
- **Toast Notifications**: Displays a custom toast notification showing the updated counter value after each click.
- **Reusability**: Can be imported and used in various parts of the app with configurable initial values.

## ðŸš€ Usage

- **Increment the Counter**: Click the `+1` button to increment the counter value.
- **Toast Notifications**: A toast will appear at the top right of the screen showing the new counter value each time the button is clicked.
