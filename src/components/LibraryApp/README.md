The [Library App](https://itkrivoshei.github.io/OdinMonoWebApps/#/BookLibrary) is a modern adaptation of a project from [The Odin Project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library), redesigned using React. This application provides a user-friendly platform for managing a personal library collection. It utilizes Material UI for styling and offers features like adding, removing, and updating book information.

## üåü Key Features

- **Add New Books**: Easily add books to the library with details like title, author, and number of pages.
- **Toggle Read Status**: Mark books as read or unread with a simple checkbox.
- **Remove Books**: Option to remove books from the library.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface, enhanced with Material UI components and a dark theme.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for a seamless user experience.

## üíª Technologies

- **React**: Utilized for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Material UI**: Provides a sleek, modern look and enhances user interaction.
- **State Management**: Uses React's useState for managing the library's state.

## üöÄ Usage

- **Managing Books**: Users can add, mark as read/unread, and delete books from their collection.
- **Interactive Forms**: Add books using a simple form that captures all necessary details.

## üìö Project Assignment

Originally designed as a JavaScript exercise from [The Odin Project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library), this Library App was redeveloped in React to demonstrate a modern approach to web application development. The assignment involved creating a simple library application where users can:

- Add new books to a library collection.
- Display each book on the page, with options to mark as read/unread and remove from the collection.
- Use an array to store book objects and functions for library management.
- Implement an interactive user interface for a seamless user experience.
- Utilize best practices in React and state management with a focus on a clean, intuitive UI.
