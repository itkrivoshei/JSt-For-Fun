# ü•Å Drum Kit App
![](https://github.com/itkrivoshei/OdinMonoWebApps/blob/main/media/DrumKit.gif?raw=true)

The Drum Kit App is a vibrant and interactive web application allowing users to create drum sounds using their keyboard. This project is a modern React/TypeScript/SCSS rendition of the Vanilla JavaScript tutorial ["Make a JavaScript Drum Kit in Vanilla JS! #JavaScript30 1/30"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego) by Wes Bos. It's an excellent example of how to transform a JavaScript project into a more structured and scalable React application while maintaining the playful and engaging essence of the original idea.

## üåü Key Features

- **Keyboard-Triggered Sounds**: Users can play different drum sounds by pressing specific keys on their keyboard.
- **Responsive UI**: Each key press animates the corresponding drum pad on the UI.
- **Dynamic Audio Playback**: Immediate audio feedback with varying drum sounds.

## üíª Technologies

- **React**: For building the interactive UI components.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- **SCSS**: For advanced styling capabilities, enhancing the visual appeal.

## üöÄ Usage

- **Play Drum Sounds**: Press designated keys (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L) to play various drum sounds.
- **Visual Feedback**: Watch as the drum pads light up and animate in response to your keyboard inputs.

## üéµ Code Highlights

This project demonstrates the use of React hooks and TypeScript for efficient and robust frontend development. Key aspects of the code include:

- **Use of `useRef` and `useEffect` Hooks**: For managing DOM references and adding event listeners.
- **Dynamic Sound Mapping**: Utilizing a record to map keys to their corresponding sound files.
- **Custom DrumKey Component**: A reusable component for each drum key, showcasing React's component-based architecture.
